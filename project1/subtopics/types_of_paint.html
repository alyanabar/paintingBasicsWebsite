         One painting medium one can use is acrylic paint. This is a very forgiving paint that can be covered easily with more acrylic paint. Acrylic paint is basically plastic. It comes in a liquid form but can dry hard in an instant. This is a good paint for any level. The drying time is short but also long enough to be able to fix any mistakes that are possibly made.

     <p>Another painting medium one can use is oil paint. This paint is used for painters who want a textured look as the paint is very thick. This paint is somewhat forgiving as it takes days to dry. This paint stays wet for a long time which can allow painters to scrape off if mistake is made. If you are not careful, this will end up on your clothes. While using this paint, I suggest an appron, open space, and clothes you don't mind getting dirty.

         The last painting medium I will mention is water-color. Water-color paint comes dry and is activated when water is on the dryed paint. This is the least forgiving painting medium I have mentioned. This will dry super fast and will leave very little room for mistakes. Although dry time can be extended with adding more water. This doesn't prevent mistakes and mistakes may not be able to be covered up. Water-color though can be fun and elegant.
