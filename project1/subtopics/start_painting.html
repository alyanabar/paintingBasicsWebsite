     <h2>How to Start a Painting</h2>
     <article>
     <h3>Get a canvas</h3>
     <p>
         To get a painting started, you need a good canvas. A canvas can be bought from an arts and crafts store. This can be any size you would like. What canvases are made up of is clothe and a wooden frame. Canvases can be made at home but for beginners, it may be cheaper to buy ready-made from the store.
     </p>
     <p>
         The canvas may need to change depending on the type of paint you use. If you use acrylic, oil, or fresco, it may be helpful to have a regular canvas from the store. If you would like to use a water based paint, it may be best to use white paper instead. Canvases can have small bumps on the surface just because of what it is made of. If water-color is used on a canvas, the color may seep into the little cracks and will ultimately change the outcome. It is important to know the best canvas for your paint type.

      <h3>Have an Idea and Start Drawing</h3>
       <p>
          Once you have your canvas ready, you can brain storm ideas of what you would like to paint and what type of paint you would like to use. This is a good idea to think about if you had a particular goal in mind. If you need some inspiration, it is great to look outside for ideas. Nature is a good way to start as it is very free flowing and forgiving because everything is organic and perfectly imperfect.
      </p>
      <p>
          After having an idea in mind, you can start on a sketch. A sketch can help you figure out the spacing, highlights, and shadows of a piece. It can also give you a framework of how your painting will look like. To help with sketching, you can also add a grid to reference from. If you are copying a photo, you can add a grid to use as measurements. If you are sketching something in real life, you can use a pencil to measure how far and close objects are. Using a pencil can also allow you to figure out an angle of an object.

    <h3>Get Paint and Brushes Ready</h3>
      <p>
          Getting your paint ready depends on the type of paint you use. Water-based colors only need water and your colors. Other paints may need a palette. A palette is a tray where you can mix or place colors. On a palette, I would suggest using what you need. This means only putting the amount of paint you need for what you are working on. This can help prevent overusing that ends with you throwing away paint. If you do end up using more than you need, you can put plastic wrap over your paint. This normally works on any type of paint but if it is a water color, you can just leave it to dry because it only activiates with water. 
      </p>

          When it comes to brushes, it depends on what you need to paint. Certain brushes can help more with clouds or blades of grass. To help with knowing what brushes can help you with what, you can make a test swipe on an excess sheet of paper to see what the brush looks like. Typically though, smaller brushes tend to help with difficult spots or fine lines and bigger brushes help with covering a lot of space with paint. Choosing a paint brush, as like a canvas, depends on what you need.
